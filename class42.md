# Ethics in Tech

## *Article 1: [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)*

* Really interesting, and heartbreaking, about the effects of a few lines of code as to the final product and outcome of the situation.
* "As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices." This quote really stood out to me, and I haven't necessarily thought of it that way before, that we are one of the last passes through before something gets put out into the world.
* That is definitely something to be taken with great weight, and to constantly assess the impact the lines of code we are writing will have.
* "Take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever present in our code." This was another piece of the article that stood out to me, keeping aware and making sure that we're always considering what's at play. That we don't just write lines of code as prescribed, but that we think at a high level what they are doing.

## *Article 2: [Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)*

* Interesting comment about re-framing big data - "Big data doesn't have to be all that big. Rather, it's about reconsideration of the fundamental economics of analyzing data."
* You decide what data is about the moment you define it's schema.
* "The only way to deal with this properly is to somehow link what the data is with how it can be used."
* This article raises a lot of great points, things to keep in mind, and the changes that need to be made in how we manage and implement the use of data.
* There's tension for how data has been managed, how it is currently, and how it will continue to be. The examples provided were really eye-opening, credit limits based on where people shop, car insurance based on profiles, etc.

## *Article 3: [Will democracy survive big data and AI?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)*

* As smart devices become smarter and take strides towards sentience, it is our responsibility to mitigate the risks associated with big data and artificial intelligence. Companies are profiting from big data, supercomputers are surpassing the capabilities of humans, and jobs are rapidly being replaced by machines. Although innovation and technology have potential catastrophic consequences, we can’t ignore the potential benefits. Modern technology has created a global community and now more than ever, we have the tools and capability to come together for massive transformative change.. I strongly believe that humanity needs to be strategic and responsible when it comes to future innovation.

## *Article 4: [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)*

* No one believes accidents will be eliminated entirely, which brings up an ethical dilemma: Who should the car harm if it finds itself in one of those unavoidable situations? Do children, elderly people or other factors change the equation

debate over how they should behave in situations they can’t anticipate is sharpening.
