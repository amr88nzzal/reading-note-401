# AWS: Cloud Servers

### 1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle.

#### The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).

### 2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
#### A server is a computer that serves information to other computers. 

### 3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
#### Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.

## Vocabulary Terms

### Server :
     a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". ... Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

### Pub/Sub :
    is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.

### WRRC :
    The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. Any computer making a request is a client and any computer sending a response is a server.

### Preparation Materials

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):

 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

### Reliable, scalable, infrastructure on demand

1. Increase or decrease capacity within minutes, not hours or days
1. SLA commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region. Each region consists of at least 3 availability zones
1. The AWS Region/AZ model has been recognized by Gartner as the recommended approach for running enterprise applications that require high availability

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.


### Flexible options to optimize cost
1. With On Demand, pay for only the compute you need. Gain up to 40% better price performance with AWS Graviton2-based instances or 10% lower costs with AMD-based instances.
1. Amazon EC2 Spot can reduce costs up to 90% or accelerate performance for fault-tolerant workloads such as big data, containers, web services, and CI/CD.
1. AWS Savings Plans offers savings of up to 72% on Amazon EC2 instances usage, regardless of instance family, size, OS, tenancy or AWS Region.
