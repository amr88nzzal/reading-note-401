# React Native

## 1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”.
- Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. 
 - Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit's goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux. 
## 2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit.
- Helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.

| Redux toolkit slices|Redux slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of application . Redux state is typically organized into slices, defined by the reducers that are passed to combineReducers.|
| Namespace| A group of related elements that each have a unique name or identifier. ... A file path, which uses syntax defined by the operating system, is considered a namespace. For example, C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer is the namespace that describes where Internet Explorer files on a Windows computer.|

  - React Native :
    - uses native components as building blocks.
  - React :
    - uses web components as building blocks.

* Building a react native app:

  - Install react native and react.
  - import { Text, View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native'
  - `<View></View>` with style attribute: renders a container.
  - `<Text>` Test goes Here `</Text>`: render a text.
  - `<Image></Image>`
  - StyleSheet.create()

* React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you’re not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

   * Basic Components Most apps will end up using one of these basic components.

    - View The most fundamental component for building a UI.

    - Text A component for displaying text.

    - Image A component for displaying images.

    - TextInput A component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard.

    - ScrollView Provides a scrolling container that can host multiple components and views.

    - StyleSheet Provides an abstraction layer similar to CSS stylesheets.
