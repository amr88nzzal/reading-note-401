# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## 1. Describe “The Cloud”.

### "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. ... By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

## 2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

### A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## 3. What is auto-scaling?

### Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.

## 4. What is bandwidth?

### Bandwidth is a measure of how much information a network can transfer. The volume of data that can be transported varies, impacting how effectively a transmission medium, such as an Internet connection, operates.

## 5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?

### When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

## Vocabulary Terms

### Server Instances : An instance is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server. If you run two copies of the software on the same physical or virtual server, that counts as two instances. When you run two copies of the software on two different physical or virtual servers, that also counts as two instances

### Containers : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

### Cloud Services : a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet, these services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware

### Cloud Architecture : the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network

### AWS : Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku : EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS), while Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product.

## Preparation Materials

### AWS S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network , and designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world. 

### AWS Lambda 

 is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtime, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

#### What are the most common use cases for AWS Lambda? 

* individual tasks run for a short time.
* each task is generally self-contained.
* there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

### CDN

Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
