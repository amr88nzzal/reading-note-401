# Context API

### 1. Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer().

- `useReducer()` is useful when you need to use complex state logic, when you have multiple sub values, or when the next state depends on the previous state.

### 2. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

- It’s a convention, and without it react wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of hooks.  

### 3. What do custom hooks usually do?

- It's allow you to extract and share logic in a way that was not possible with class components. 

### 4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications.

- useWebSocket would be useful when building a game web app that needs to communicate with a websocket api.

### 5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work.
-An API fetching hook would take in a url and any info necessary for the request and return the results of the API call. It could use a callback to update the state with the returned results.

## Vocabulary Terms:

* Reducer:
  - is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.

### Context API

- **Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

- Before You Use Context :Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

- If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

- Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

- The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.
