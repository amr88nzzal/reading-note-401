# Graphs

## Terminology

* Graph: non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
* Vertex: also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge: connection between two nodes.
* Neighbor: neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes (connected via an edge).
* Degree: degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


## Two kinds of graphs:

1. An `Undirected Graph` is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

2. `Directed Graphs (Digraph)`
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

- Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

1. `Complete Graphs` are ones that each node in the graph is connected to all other nodes in the graph. Which means that we can go from any node to all other nodes in just weight of 1.
   
2. `Connected Graph` is graph that has all of nodes have at least one edge. Looking closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph.
   
3. `A disconnected graph` is a graph where some vertices may not have edges. Some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is completely possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

* `Acyclic Graph`: directed graph without cycles
  * Cycle: when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself
* Directed acyclic graph (DAG): can also be represented as what we know as a tree.
* `A Cyclic graph`: graph that has cycles
  * Cycle: defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

### Graph Representation

* `Adjacency Matrix:` An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix. Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection. For undirected graphs, the matrix will always be symmetric.
  
* `An adjacency list` is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

* Edge List: Which is a list that contains all individual edges represented as pairs of keys and values.

### Weighted Graphs

`A weighted graph` is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
* Weighted graph: graph with numbers assigned to its edges, the numbers are called weights.
* When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths.

 

Within adjacency lists, you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex. A great way to represent the {vertices, weight} connection is through some sort of key/value pair data structure.

## Real World Uses of Graphs

* GPS and Mapping.
* Driving Directions.
* Social Networks.
* Airline Traffic.
* Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products.
